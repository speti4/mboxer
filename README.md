# mboxer

A Windows 11 viewer for large Gmail Takeout mbox archives (14–50 GB): fast indexed search,
stable, usable UI. Replaces [eneam/mboxviewer](https://github.com/eneam/mboxviewer) for the author
and a handful of colleagues, each with their own mbox file.

- Stack: Rust, Tauri 2 on WebView2, one-time sidecar full-text index next to the mbox (see
  `tasks/decisions/`).
- Status and backlog: `tasks/README.md` (generated), milestones in `tasks/roadmap.md`.
- Why this exists: `docs/origin.md`; why build and not buy: `docs/research/`.
- Build instructions: arrive with task 002 (Rust workspace).
